**enum: Formal Combinatorics**

Overview
========

By *formal combinatorics* we mean studying combinatorics with a computer. 
This research activity includes the widespread use of a computer algebra system,
but also programming of algorithms for the bounded-exhaustive or random
generation of combinatorial objects, or of exact or asymptotic formulas for
their number for various size parameters, in various formal languages. Less
popular but more and more frequent are the uses of a proof assistant or an
automatic prover to demonstrate with a computer combinatorial theorems or
properties of combinatorial programs.

This project gathers contributions in formal combinatorics:
